"""Python's scoping rules, as code.

There are lots of invariants and ideas not yet expressed in code:

- scopes form a tree with a GlobalScope at the root
- there are no GlobalScopes elsewhere in the tree
- *using* a name before a nonlocal declaration is also an error
- a way to check a scope's invariants
- locals/nonlocals/globals are disjunct
- everything about comprehensions
- translating the AST into a tree of scopes
- Using a subset of Python

Everything about scopes:

Every Scope corresponds to a module, a function, or a class.
	A function includes function defs, lambdas, and comprehensions.

Scopes form a tree, starting with a GlobalScope object.  Scope.nested is a list of the subtree Scopes.

A Scope has variables.  A variable (or 'var') is a name which is found in the scope.
	In the global scope, it may also be a var which is declared global in a nested scope.

It provides static status of various Var names seen in the scope.

A scope has a "ref" attribute, which is an arbitrary object supplied to the constructor.
This can be used by a builder function to build the scope and its nested scopes.
The nested scopes will have their own "ref" attributes.

Static status of a var.
	This involves a "binding scope" for the var, which is the same or an enclosing Scope.
	Status is one of the following, and may evolve while the scope is being examined:
		Unknown.  The var does not appear yet.
		Local.  A value is bound somewhere in the scope, including:
			assignment or reassignment,
			deletion,
			a walrus operator in a nested comprehension.
			This is only if var is not already declared nonlocal or global.
			The binding scope is the current scope
		Nonlocal.  The binding scope is a specific enclosing closed scope where the var is Local.
		Global.  The binding scope is the global scope.
		Top.  This is used instead of Local and Global in the global scope for a var that is bound there.
		Used.  The var appears in this scope but it not yet Local, Nonlocal, or Global.
			The binding scope is None.  The purpose of this status is to prevent further
			nonlocal or global declarations.
	Unknown will change to one of the others the first time the var is seen in the scope.
	Used will change to Local the first time the var is used in a binding situation.
	Used will change to Nonlocal or Global otherwise, some time after all uses of the var
		in the current scope have been reported.

Building the Scope: This consists of:
	1.	Note all names in the code for the scope,
		except for nested function and class defs:
			Do not include the body of the def, or any names (such as function
			arguments) which are known in the context of the nested scope.
			Create a scope object for the def.  This will be treated as an assignment
			of the def's name in the current scope.
			Do include other names appearing in the def statement other than the var,
			such as function default values, base classes, etc.
	2.	Do the entire build (recursively) on all the nested scopes.
			A walrus in a nested comprehension can change a var from Used to Local.
			If the binding scope is needed by some nested scope, then this can
			change the var from Used to Nonlocal or Global.
	3.	Resolve all remaining Used vars by finding the binding scopes for them, making them
		either Nonlocal or Global.

	This done with the Scope.build() method.

	It uses a builder function, which is stored in the Scope.builder attribute.
	This is provided to the global scope constructor.
	It is inherited by a nested scope, unless a different builder is provided.

	The function of the builder is to report any use of any var in the Scope which exists.
	It excludes any var which was reported to the parent Scope earlier.
	For functions, classes, and comprehensions,
		Report the nesting of a new scope.  For function and class defs, include the name,
		which will become bound in the current scope.
		Report vars occurring in the following:
			function argument defaults,
			class bases,
			class definition arguments,
			decorators.
			in comprehensions, all walrus operators at any level of nesting.
				If current scope is a class, this is a SyntaxError.

Operations on a Scope performed by its builder:
	Note, all enclosing scopes will have been completely built by this time.
	load(var).  Just reports the fact that this var appears.
	add_global(var).  Declares the var to be in the global scope.
		If earlier loaded in a non-global scope, this is an error.
		Also adds a load(var) to the global scope.
	add_nonlocal(var).  Declares the var to be in an enclosing closed scope.
		If earlier loaded, or the enclosing scope is not found, this is an error.
	store(var).  Notes the fact that the var has been assigned, reassigned or deleted.
	store_walrus(var):  Records an assignment via := operator contained somewhere in an
		immediately nested comprehension.  Same as store(), except SyntaxError in
		certain cases.

	nest(...).  Notes a nested Scope.  Creates a Scope for it and stores the name as well.
		Arguments provided:
			A subclass of Scope to be used.
			A ref object.
			An optional name, for function and class defs only.
			An optional builder for the new Scope, defaults to the builder of the current scope.

After the Scope's builder is complete, these operations are valid:

	binding_scope(var).  Returns the binding scope for the var, if any.
		If one exists for the var, that scope is returned.
		Else the var is Used or Unknown.  The scope is found by looking at enclosing scopes.
			If found, then this is stored in this scope, which makes it Nonlocal or Global.
			If Global, then load(var) is performed on the global scope as well.
			If not found, returns None.

		These are the binding_scope resolution rules:
		1.	If the var is Local, returns itself.
		2.	The global scope returns itself.
		3.	An open scope returns the global scope.
		4.	A closed scope returns its nonlocal_scope() if there is one,
			otherwise returns the global scope.

	nonlocal_scope(var).  Looks for a closed scope which will match a nonlocal declaration
		in a nested scope, using the parent chain.

		These are the nonlocal_scope rules:
		1.	An open scope returns its parent.nonlocal_scope().
		2.	The global scope returns None.
		3.	A closed scope returns itself if var is Local,
			otherwise returns its parent.nonlocal_scope().
