# Towards Semi-formal Semantics For PythonÌ£

Guido van Rossum, 2022

[For the previous set of ramblings, [look here](informal.md).]

## Introduction

It would be nice to have a more formal specification of Python.
A few things are getting in the way:

- The language is rather big and has grown organically.
- Much of the semantics depend on data types (list, dict, str etc.).
- Practical backwards compatibility is determined by details of CPython.

My approach here is to first identify the many layers,
and then focus on the layers that are the most in need of specification
(IMO that's the execution model).

In first approximation we can identify the following layers,
which roughly parallel the stages of a typical compiler and runtime:

- Lexical analysis (tokenizing)
- Syntactic analysis (parsing)
- Semantic analysis (symbol table, identifier scope analysis)
- Code generation
- Code execution
- Built-in data types
- Importing modules
- Standard library

I'll briefly go over each of these.

### Lexical analysis

This is specified well in [Lexical analysis
](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/lexical_analysis.html)
in the language reference.

### Syntactic analysis

See [Full Grammar specification
](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/grammar.html)
in the language reference for the grammar, and [Parser/Python.asdl
](https://github.com/python/cpython/blob/main/Parser/Python.asdl)
in the source code for the AST node definition.

Here we're also in a fairly good spot.
There is a formal grammar
(albeit using PEG, which is more complicated than context-free grammars)
and a formal definition of AST nodes.
The mapping from grammar to AST uses C code but should be straightforward.
All further processing of code uses AST nodes as input.

Some constraints that are considered syntactic constraints
are not expressed in the grammar,
e.g. the placement of `return` and `yield` inside functions,
the placement of `await`, `async for` and `async with` inside `async def`,
and the placement of `break` and `continue` inside loops.
These are checked ad-hoc in a separate next stage of compilation
(perhaps as part of semantic analysis).

Other examples include the requirement that parameter names are unique
(rejecting function definitionas like `def f(x, x):`)
and that keyword arguments are unique
(rejecting calls like `f(x=1, x=1)`).

### Semantic analysis

See [Naming and binding
](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/executionmodel.html#naming-and-binding)
in the language reference.
It's not clear to me that that explains all the rules, though.

The task of this stage is to assign each identifier a scope.
This is a sufficiently complex process that I wrote it up
in much more detail than the language reference,
[here](https://gvanrossum.github.io/formal/scopesblog.html).
