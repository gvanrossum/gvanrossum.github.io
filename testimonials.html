            "We have used Python to develop a simple multicast protocol which we use to automatically reload a lab of 200 NT based systems
            from an image server. The entire lot is reloaded in 7 minutes, the network remains 85% available, Python helped
            us write the server in an afternoon!"

            which will further extend the reach of the Python language."

            "Over the past 30 years, I've written code in every major programming language. Python is my favorite programming language
            by a wide margin. It's an elegant, well-designed language that can be learned in a few hours. In addition, the
            code is easy to read and large systems are easy to maintain. The same code runs all major platoforms without
            re-coding or re-compiling. There is simply no faster way to develop applications. A skilled Python programmer
            can, on average, crank out applications five times faster than a programmer in more traditional languages. Java
            and Perl have more "hype", but Python is much faster to learn, easier to code, easier to debug, and easier to
            read. The language is also easy to extend because the source code of the underlying system is very clean and
            freely available.

            "Our award-winning Ultraseek Search engine is coded in Python. It's won every competitive review we know about. Today's version
            has many more features than any of our competitors. Yet the original version, which had features comparable to
            our competitors, was coded in only 3 months by one programmer who didn't know Python before he started."
