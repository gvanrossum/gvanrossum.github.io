            Roger Masse and Joyce Gearhart (and yes they're still my friends!) in Silver Spring, Maryland, which is about
            45 minutes from Reston on a good day.

        <h2>
            <a name=tom HREF="images/Tom2.jpeg" target="_blank">Tom's adventures</a>
        </h2>
        <p>
            Since I was going to be here for a year, I decided long ago that I wanted to take my cat Tom with me. He's a somewhat shy
            10 year old male, tabby (i.e. gray/black tiger pattern) with an almost completely black back, and everybody thinks
            he's cute.
        </p>
        <p>
            Here's how he survived the trip and adapted to his new environment.
        </p>
        <h3>Tom's trip</h3>
        <p>
            I called various authorities and it's not so difficult to bring a cat into the US. He needs a rabies shot at least 30 days
            and at most 12 months before he enters the country, plus a declaration of good health signed by a vet. I took
            care of all this in January.
        </p>
        <p>
            Originally I though I would have to give him a tranquillizer pill for the trip, but when I mentioned this to the vet who
            gave him his rabies shot, he didn't think it was a very good idea: first, I would have to experiment with the
            dose, which differs per cat; next, it doesn't last the whole trip; and finally, he said, although it will appear
            a traumatic experience at first, actually it's not such a big deal for a cat: they're tough, and once he's on
            the plane he'll get used to it and accept it. The whole trip will be forgotten soon after he's free again.
        </p>
        <p>
            Traveling with a cat on a plane is more work than getting the paperwork done: you need to request permission in advance to
            carry the cat in the cabin (I didn't want to leave him on the luggage deck for 8 hours). You also need to pay
            as for oversize baggage. My travel agent took care of this, at least I got a phone call and a letter from them
            saying it was alright if I paid F. 318 at the airport.
        </p>
        <p>
            Of course, practice and theory differed. Tom didn't like it to be locked up in a small box, and started howling, but that
            was to be expected. At the check-in counter, nobody would believe that I had requested and gotten permission
            to carry Tom on board until some higher manager arrived. I paid my F. 318 and proceeded to the gate.
        </p>
        <p>
            Once on the plane, there was another problem: the box didn't fit under a chair. Apparently this was a rule that the travel
            agent never told me. Again, a high manager arrived and said that this was highly unusual, but since there was
            enough space (in fact the plane was half empty) I could leave him on the floor. He then proceeded to threaten
            me that if I let Tom out of his box (which I had already made clear wasn't my plan at all) he had ways of having
            the FAA wait for me at the landing site.
        </p>
        <p>
            After this initial hassle, things went relatively well. The flight personnel were friendly and asked how Tom was doing, and
            gave me some water that I managed to force down his throat so he wouldn't completely dry out. (Food was completely
            out of the question, the poor animal was upset enough.) He moaned a lot, especially during take-off and landing
            (when he seemed to double his volume and everybody around me looked at us), but after cruising for a while he
            was quiet as long as I didn't talk to him (then he would start crying again for a while).
        </p>
        <p>
            I had put a towel in his box to make him comfortable, and of course he wetted it somewhat, but other than that he didn't
            make a big mess. In total, the vet was probably right.
        </p>
        <h3>Tom in America</h3>
        <p>
            Looking back, I think Tom's adapted to his new environment much faster and better than I had expected. After three days he
            was already roaming around in the garden without fear, and after a week he seemed pretty much at ease. My hosts
            (Roger and Joyce) have three cats of their own, so we feared frightful confrontations, but these have been mostly
            friendly.
        </p>
        <p>
            The first day we gave him his own place to feel comfortable: my bedroom, where we put some food, water and a litter box for
            him. He used all three within half an hour, but spent most time hiding under the bed. If I came by and talked
            to him he would come out and let himself be stroked, but generally he maintained a safe and hidden position.
        </p>
        <p>
            Later that day he met one of the other cats. Maintaining a safe distance, he hissed and roared frightfully, but since the
            other cat (being more used to new animals in the house) didn't react agressively, no fight broke out, and Tom
            eventually turned away.
        </p>
        <p>
            Sunday morning I got up really early and decided to wander around the house somewhat. Tom followed me and when we reached
            the cat door in the basement he needed only a little encouragement (read: a little push) to use it. Careful but
            interested, he started to walk around in the garden. I carried him back in, worried that he might get lost or
            pick a fight with a strange cat (not one of Roger and Joyce's). The rest of the day he sort of stayed in my room
            upstairs, but came out occasionally to investigate other rooms of the house. Whenever he met one of the other
            cats he started hissing and growling again, but none of them wanted to fight (although two of them are males).
        </p>
        <p>
            During the next days we had to leave him alone for longer times. Tuesday morning he went outside by his own choice and probably
            had a good time -- when we came home he was back inside (in my room, his hiding place). In the evening he ventured
            out again and wouldn't be caught; only after I had gone to bed he came back in to use the litter box and eat
            something.
        </p>
        <p>
            The following week, the pattern continued: although at times he came back to my bedroom, he was around the house a lot, responded
            less agressively to the other cats, and even engaged in regular petting sessions with Joyce (Roger still scares
            him, though). At night he sleeps in my room, on or besides the bed. The litter box remains largely unused --
            he must have discovered the comfort of the backyard (especially the large forest-like park behind it)...
        </p>
        <h2>
            <a name=sport>* Sporting events</a>
        </h2>
        <p>
            My temporary hosts Roger and Joyce are absolute health and fitness freaks. Roger has the physique of Arnold Schwarzenegger
            and his nickname at work is "healthboy". Joyce isn't that muscular but looks very healthy and fit, and both engage
            in at least one sporting activity per day.
        </p>
        <h3>Swimming</h3>
        <p>
            Standard practice on weekdays is to get up at or before 6 to go for a swim in the Municipal pool. Before entering the water
            they do 20 minutes of sit-ups. They then swim for almost an hour (with some short breaks). I generally join them
            (not for the sit-ups though!) and manage to swim as long as they do. Although I'm more than a bit slower, I still
            swim at least 64 25-meter laps each time, or at least a mile!
        </p>
        <p>
            Using some advice from Roger and encouragement from both, I'm also learning to swim front crawl, which I never managed at
            swimming lessons when I was a kid. It's still a lot more exhaustive than breast stroke, and I don't manage more
            than two laps of front crawl at a time (usually I then do 5-10 laps of breast stroke to relax), but I'm definitely
            improving -- it's all a matter of practice and breathing technique...
        </p>
        <p>
            The pool is very modern, and not very crowded. There are 16 lanes and normally no more than two people per lane (I've been
            told it's busier at other times). We have our daily shower after swimming -- I use a lot of shampoo to get rid
            of the chlorine taste!
        </p>
        <p>
            + Predictably, my swimming schedule didn't last -- in the last two weeks that I stayed with Roger &amp; Joyce I went to the
            pool only twice, and now that I've moved to Reston I'm completely on my own. For a natural night owl like me,
            it's unlikely that I'll get up at 6 to go to the pool -- Reston has many good outdoor pools though, and I should
            be able to swim at other times of the day or in the weekend...
        </p>
        <h3>In-line roller skating </h3>
        <p>
            Another favorite sport, more for the weekend, is in-line roller skating. Roger and Joyce had taken me roller skating once
            before when I was here last year, and the first Sunday of my current stay we went again, to the same park (Seneca
            Creek State Park). This time my friend Ken Manheimer also joined us. The roads in the park are very smooth and
            quiet, so it is easy to skate. I am borrowing Roger's old skates -- they are my size and although the buckles
            don't always stay put, I am managing to stay upright on them. I'm also equipped with a bicycle helmet, kneecaps
            (sometimes) and some kind of protective thingies for my hands, but I haven't fallen a single time yet.
        </p>
        <p>
            In Holland, this would probably feel a lot like ice skating, but since the park has hills, it is actually more like a combination
            of ice skating against the wind (uphill) and downhill skiing (the downhill parts). I quickly got the hang of
            it, and now feel quite confident riding down a steep hill at an enormous speed!
        </p>
        <h3>Contact Improv</h3>
        <p>
            Perhaps more an art than a sport, Contact Improv looks like a combination of freestyle modern dance and yoga, but more "touchy-feely".
            Sunday afternoon, after the roller skating, Ken took me to a Contact Improv jam in downtown Washington. This
            was on a small field at the "Mall", the big green area around which the Congress, the White House and many monuments
            and museums are grouped, and a big spot for tourists.
        </p>
        <p>
            We were joined by about a dozen people from Ken's regular Contact Improv group, as well as a few Contact Improv people from
            elsewhere (they are a bit like one big worldwide family). The weather was marvelous, and at times I felt more
            like just lying in the grass, in the sun, rather than joining the group activity (which is mostly groups of two
            or three people keeping close and continuously varying body contact for a short while before they regroup).
        </p>
        <p>
            + I should write more about Contact Improv -- the weekly class and jam at an old dance gym at American University in DC has
            become a regular part of my Sunday afternoons, and I've also gone to a more formal "class" once.
        </p>
        <h2>
            <a name=car>Car shopping</a>
        </h2>

            One of the necessities in life in the USA is a car. Last year, as a visitor for two months, I rented one, but the cost of
            renting even a small cranky car for a year would be prohibitively expensive, so I've accepted my fate -- I'll
            have to buy one. Moreover, I'll have to buy a new one -- with my total lack of mechanical insight, if I tried
            to buy a used care I'm sure I'd waste my money on a lemon and would have to spend a fortune on having it fixed
            each month...
        </p>
        <p>
            This Saturday, Roger took me car shopping. The plan was not to buy anything, but to get more insight in what size, brand,
            model and options I was interested in, as well as to figure out what would be the best way to finance the thing.
            Fortunately, I did my homework: the April issue of Consumer Report had a special on cars (this is the great car
            buying season), with good advice, tips on how to haggle (basically, you're a fool to pay the "sticker price"),
            and reviews of more cars than I cared about. We managed to narrow the choice down to a manageable number of mid-range
            mid-price cars: I don't like to feel like sailing a boat, but given the length of the average commute in this
            area (something like a half hour one way) I don't want a tiny car either.
        </p>
        <p>
            Somehow the salesmen (they come in all colors but I've seen no women do this job) can either tell by a mark on your forehead
            how many dealers you've already visited, or they become less tenacious as the day passes, or we became more experienced,
            but in any case, we spent over two hours at the first dealer, more than one hour at the second, and even less
            at the third one.
        </p>
        <p>
            The local Ford dealer was the lucky one to receive us first. We'd heard good stories from Ken about the Contour (a new model).
            We were welcomed into the store by Lou, an over-friendly if somewhat sweaty young man in white shirt and tie
            (we, on the other hand, wore shorts and T-shirts).
        </p>
        <p>
            We requested a test drive. No problem, the lot was full of new Contours. What options did we want? Well, me being from Europe
            (it's hard to deny...), I wanted to try out a manual transmission, and this being a hot area in the summer Roger
            suggested that I wanted air conditioning. The latter was no problem (although in theory an option, it's installed
            on nearly all cars sold around here) but to find one without an automatic transmission we had to search around
            the lot for a while. Finally he found one. There was one problem: there were cars parked all around it, so he
            had to move at least one other car to get it out.
        </p>
        <p>
            It wasn't Lou's lucky day. He had to manoeuver a brand new metallic green car through a narrow opening between two other
            cars, and the end of it all was that one white car's bumper had a few green scratches, and the green car had
            two dents and a number of scratches. After this he had to drive our Contour through the same opening, which he
            did with rather more care.
        </p>
        <p>
            Once we were safely parked outside the lot, Lou started praising the car. In fact, we had a hard time stopping him praising
            the car. Roger may actually have caught some of what he said, but for me the lingo about "dual cams" and other
            technical advances was well above my head.
        </p>
        <p>
            Finally, I could begin the test drive. After a few turns the car proved to be quite comfortable, although Lou kept us busy
            with his endless stream of praise for the car.
        </p>
        <p>
            Next, we asked if we could also test an automatic. Sure! This time Lou took considerably more care to move the cars that
            surrounded the desired model, and soon enough, the test drive could begin. It felt AWFUL! I have driven many
            automatic cars (it's hardly impossible to find a rental with manual transmission) but I've never had the opportunity
            to compare a manual transmission to an automatic transmission on the same car. Now I know why in Europe, automatic
            transmissions are still considered to be for sissies (my American friends got a big laugh when I mentioned the
            image of the average driver of an automatic in Europe as an elderly lady).
        </p>
        <p>
            The test drives together took us less than an hour, but Lou wasn't ready to let go of us just yet. Perhaps our attempts to
            pose as serious buyers were too successful, perhaps he just was in a fighting mood, anyway he tried every trick
            in the book (and in particular everything I had read in an articule in Consumer Report on car salesmen) to keep
            us in his office and to tempt us to agree to a buy there and then. Several times he walked up to his sales manager
            to ask if he could lower his price (tactic: leave them alone for a long time). He mentioned that he would be
            able to make a really good price if we were ready to buy today (tactic: try to hurry them into buying instead
            of checking the competition). He dazzled us with numbers about monthly payment terms, 24-, 36- and 48-month leases,
            and interest figures. He wrote down our names, addresses, phone numbers and other personal data. Yet he could
            not produce a glossy folder ("they were all taken out on a road show and the stock pile is on an attic in supplies
            that I can't reach now") nor a business card.
        </p>
        <p>
            Eventually the sales manager joined us and tried the same tactics, only with more authority in his voice. After more than
            an hour of negotiating the price had gone down only $500 or so from the sticker price -- while I knew that Ken
            had bought his Contour, with at least $1000 worth of extra options, for only a little more!
        </p>
        <p>
            Finally we got the message through that we were interested but not today. We were shown out of the showroom, with promises
            of a glossy folder in the mail by Monday, and good luck on our search for the perfect automibile.
        </p>
        <p>
            The next dealer, where we investigated the Geo Prizm (which I liked almost as much during the test drive as the Contour),
            tried the same tactics, but this salesman was a lot less experienced, and never got us to the bargaining phase.
            He did walk up to the finance department a few times and cam back with wildly incongruent and ubelievably high
            numbers for the monthly payments, so we left him alone in his confusion and moved to dealer number three.
        </p>
        <p>
            At Honda, things are done differently. We got to spin two models (a larger and a smaller one, because I wanted to feel the
            difference) without being accompanied by the salesman, who appeared to be busy closing another deal. I didn't
            particular like either car, and our guy was happy to see us leave, it appeared. Perhaps it was because of the
            three marks on our foreheads?
        </p>
        <p>
            Anyway, it was 4.30 PM by now, and we hadn't had lunch yet, so we decided to get some. Roj took me to a place where, he said,
            Joyce would never come. Indeed, the place specialized in sandwiches and hamburgers of the kind that has made
            America the land of cholesterol -- but the service was friendly while unobtrusive, the decor was homey, and the
            cheeseburger and fries were excellent.
        </p>
        <p>
            Later that day, we test drove two Toyota's, again a larger and a smaller model. The salesboy took us on a tour of the lot
            in search for the car we wanted -- which was nearly impossible to find because Toyota doesn't seem to believe
            in manual transmissions. Their lot is f***ing HUGE -- and it was getting chilly while we were still dressed the
            same as earlier. Luckily he found an unattended vehicle that we could use to drive back to the office so he could
            pick up the keys, and to drive us back to the car we wanted...

            <a name=licence>Getting a driver's licence
            </a>
        </h2>
        <p>
            I realized that, in order to be able to
            <i>drive</i>
            a car that I would buy, I needed it to be insured first -- and to get car insurance, I would need to have a local driver's
            licence.
        </p>
        <p>
            I called the Maryland Motor Vehicle Administration (MVA). They have a computerized system now that lets you press the buttons
            on your phone to hear prerecorded messages on all kinds of subjects. Unfortunately you have to listen until the
            end of each message before you can make a menu selection, and if you make a mistake you are generally thrown
            back in the main menu, so it took me half an hour to find out what I had to do. Then again, CNRI has phones with
            speakers so at least my left ear didn't get burnt, and I could do some work in the mean time.
        </p>
        <p>
            On a nice sunny Monday, I drove to the MVA office. A line of people started around the corner of the building, reminding
            me of the rides in Disneyland -- so I was glad I brought a book with me. Fortunately, within two minutes I found
            out that I was in the wrong line -- this was for licence plates ("tags"), and I needed to enter the line for
            driver's licences, which started inside the building. I filled out my form, read my book for half an hour, and
            finally it was my turn. Passport, Dutch driver's licence, everything was okay. Now what did I have to do next?
            "Go to the law office down the hall for a law and eye test, they'll tell you what to do next."
        </p>
        <p>
            The MVA's "law office" was a small room equipped with a bunch of computers. The eye test took about four seconds (stick my
            head in a kind of Viewmaster machine and read the text at the bottom line). For the law test I had to sit in
            front of a computer that was programmed to ask twenty multiple choice questions, such as "which of these three
            pictures is the hand gesture for making a left turn?" and "when you see flashing red or orange lights, what should
            you do?" I missed only two out of twenty, but got several others right only by sheer guesswork.
        </p>
        <p>
            So what was next? It turned out that I really had to take a driving test (the first officer had circled this on my form and
            had also written "D.T." on it in large letters). But first I had to sit in on a "3 Hour Alcohol and Drugs Education
            Program", required by the State of Maryland. The MVA doesn't organize this -- I got a bad photocopy of a list
            of driving schools and drugs rehab centers that apparently were licenced by the state to give these classes.
        </p>
        <h3>Alcohol and drugs education</h3>
        <p>
            The next day at CNRI I phoned around to some of the listed addresses. Prices varied between $20 and $35, but times were remarkably
            similar: once a week, usually on Saturday. I chose the cheapest class, which also happened to be nearby where
            I lived. Class would be this Saturday at 1 PM.
        </p>
        <p>
            The same night there was a message on Roger &amp; Joyce's voicemail (that's like an answering machine but it's done by the
            phone company's computers) that the class had been moved to 9 AM. Oh well.
        </p>
        <p>
            That Saturday, I drove to the given address. Although the building was easily found, it didn't carry a large friendly neon
            sign with the name of the driving school that I had selected ("Easyway Driving School" -- it gave me a sense
            of comfort). On the ground level there were a bank office and something like a hair salon, but nothing that resembled
            a driving school. There was an open door which led up to stairs. A sign listed a variety of small businesses,
            but no driving school. I began to panic -- especially since it was 5 past 9 by now.
        </p>
        <p>
            I decided to go upstairs anyway and see what was there. It didn't look good. Most offices looked like they were in the early
            stages of remodelling -- i.e. the furniture had been removed and there were people ripping ceilings out and removing
            trash. Just when I was about to give up, I noticed a closed door with a red sign nailed on it. "Easyway Driving
            School" it said. So I knocked... And was let in.
        </p>
        <p>
            The classroom was a nearly bare room (only a desk, a video, a whiteboard and some foldable chairs), but it was clear that
            it was being used for lessons in traffic theory, from the pile of "situation boards" lying in a corner. I bet
            there was a box of toy cars somewhere as well, but was quickly sucked into the practicalities of class, such
            as signing my name and address and paying my $20.
        </p>
        <p>
            There were only 4 "students" -- the other three were women. Two of them were accompanied by their husband or boyfriend (the
            third woman's husband was waiting outside. There was loud banging to be heard during parts of the class, and
            at one point two ceiling boards near the side were removed from our room...
        </p>
        <p>
            The teacher, a friendly black man from Nigeria, taught of math and English in high school -- it must have been a relief for
            him to have a quiet class for a change. He didn't hide the fact that his story was highly politically motivated.
            The State of Maryland wants us to drink as much as we like and to drive as much as we like, as long as we don't
            drink and drive. (Sure I though, both drinking and driving must bring in lots of taxes :-)
        </p>
        <p>
            About drugs, on the other hand, he had only bad things to tell. Of course, marijuana is listed with equal status as crack,
            heroine and some things I hadn't even heard of (not that he made us any wiser -- all he told us about PCP was
            what the acronym stands for).
        </p>
        <p>
            Near the end he shamelessly started to tell us the answers to the twenty multiple choice questions (20 seems to be the standard
            number :-) that awaited us at the end of the class. The test itself took about five minutes -- all of us passed
            with perfect scores. The remaining 25 minutes were devoted to carefully writing out the certificates. I got mine
            last because I lived closest -- nice touch (for the others)!
        </p>
        <p>
            Now all I need is show up at the MVA with my certificate to take a driving test. Any workday between 8.30 and 4.30 is okay,
            no need for an appointment. I'm told that it only takes 15 minutes, so what do I have to fear...?
        </p>
        <h3>Driving test</h3>
        <p>
            Nothing, it turns out. On Thursday morning I borrowed Roger's car (he was ill, how convenient :-) and drove to the MVA. The
            building was a lot quieter than the first time! After only a moderate amount of queueing I found the driving
            test office, where I was given a piece of cardboard with a number written on it and told to drive around the
            building to the place where the test started, and to wait for the examiner.
        </p>
        <p>
            So I did. There were no other cars. The examiner showed up, checked my name etc., and told me the procedure. Basically, we
            were to drive around in a "playground" next to the MVA's parking lot, where toy traffic signs indicated make-believe
            traffic situations. There was no other traffic; he told me to imagine that there was though, to make things "more
            realistic".
        </p>
        <p>
            Apart from stopping at a stop sign, yielding at a yield sign, and using my blinkers at left and right turns, there were three
            "tasks" I had to perform: driving backwards in a straight line, turning in a narrow "box", and parallel parking.
            For the latter I needed three tries -- the third try was perfect.
        </p>
        <p>
            This was it. There was no interaction with other traffic. Still, I was a little nervous -- had I used my blinkers correctly?
            Had he seen me look in my mirrors? No worry, I passed. I had failed to observe traffic a few times, but the examiner
            helpfully suggested that if there had been actual traffic around, I would have observed it...
        </p>
        <p>
            So back to the office for my licence.
        </p>
        <p>
            Whoa, not so fast... Turns out there was a reason why the building was so quiet. On all desks, a sign said "computers are
            down", and the help desk confirmed that they were down "indefinitely". I was offered the choice to wait "indefinitely"
            or come back at a later time. Seeing that there was still plenty of time for a full work day at CNRI, I chose
            the latter.
        </p>
        <p>
            Saturday morning, I returned to the MVA. Busy, busy, busy! So the computers were up. First line: to get a number for the
            real line. Second line, about half an hour, to get my form verified and entered into the computer. Third: for
            the cashier, to pay my $30. Fourth: for the camera, to get my picture taken. ("Where did you get those great
            glasses?") Fifth line: waiting for the actual licence. Actually, the whole procedure took only about an hour.
            Curious thing: today, nobody was interested in seeing my passport or Dutch driver's licence -- I could have given
            my form (which proved that I had passed the test etc.) to anyone and they would have come in possession of a
            genuine Maryland driver's licence wih their picture on it... But I didn't -- I kept it to myself.
        </p>
        <p>
            Now fully licenced, I decided to go:
        </p>
        <h2>
            <a name=car2>More car shopping</a>
        </h2>
        <p>
            After the previous shopping experience, I had decided that it would be a tie between the Geo Prizm and the Ford Contour;
            but first I wanted to test the Dodge Neon. I had rented a Neon last year and liked it better than most other
            rental vehicles, if only because it wasn't so BIG and didn't have so many electric gadgets (power locks, windows,
            mirrors). It also has distinctive looks, and is available in red.
        </p>
        <p>
            Another realization was that I would pay for it in cash. Both the Ford and the Geo dealer that I had previously seen, came
            up with very unfavorable numbers for leasing or borrowing money, based on my status as an alien with no provable
            (US) credit record. Then came the realization that I actually had enough money in my Dutch savings to just pay
            cash, being my own bank -- surely borrowing money would cost me more in interest than the corresponding amount
            of money in a savings account could ever yield. Moreover, everybody pictured the image of car dealers drooling
            at the thought of getting a car paid for in cash, which would give me a better bargaining position. So I emailed
            Sjoerd (the keeper of my money in Holland) to transfer a suitable amount to my US bank account, just in case
            I would decide on buying a car soon...
        </p>
        <p>
            Thus decided, I went to the Neon dealer. The test drive was uneventful but I didn't really like the way the clutch operated
            -- this could be "newness" however. The saleswoman (!) touted Neon's superior horsepower compared to the other
            cars I was interested in (although she didn't really understand why I was comparing it to a Ford Contour, a bigger
            car). I couldn't leave the shop without trying to negotiate a price, she was ready to go about $1K5 below the
            sticker price.
        </p>
        <p>
            Next stop, Geo. (All dealers conveniently in the same "Auto Park", about five minutes from Roger &amp; Joyce.) This time
            I could actually test drive the red Prizm that was in the showroom the last time I was here. Driving it felt
            considerably better than the Neon, never mind its lower horsepower. The salesman explained this was due to the
            Prizm's higher "torque". What's torque? Never mind -- this techno-talk is completely lost on me, I have to rely
            on my intuition and Consumer Report. We drove by Roger and Joyce, who were busy in the garden. The salesman even
            helped Joyce determine that the insects flying around the house were winged ants, not termites. Surely a useful
            fellow!
        </p>
        <p>
            He was very insistent on doing business with me -- I barely escaped without agreeing on a sale, but he eventually accepted
            my explanation that I wanted to compare it with the Contour. He did immediately agree with my suggestion to set
            the price at $200 above the "Factory Invoice" -- a figure indicating what the dealer paid the factory for the
            car, undoubtedly almost as fictitious as the "Sticker Price" (the first asking price, which nobody ever pays).
            This brought the car's price down by about $750 (assuming he wasn't lying). Notice that I didn't have any money
            with me -- he still wanted to close the deal today, saying that I could write a check when the money had actually
            arrived in my bank account sometime next week. Even my being uninsured didn't worry him -- I could get temporary
            insurance via the dealer. But first I wanted to see the Contour...
        </p>
        <p>
            Of course I had forgotten that this was the most tenacious dealer of all. The test ride went very smooth (this time no other
            cars were injured). I believe I drove the same car as the previous time, and I liked it as much. The comparison
            with the Geo was difficult -- the Contour is definitely bigger and has a more powerful engine, but driving it
            felt similar, and featurewise this car was sparser equipped (no sunroof or pinstripe or floormats) but sported
            electric mirrors. The trunk looked considerably bigger.
        </p>
        <p>
            However, the real reason that I bought it was the salesman's perseverance. He simply did not want to mention a price, but
            instead challenged me to name my price. Scary tactics! I first tried the same trick as with Geo ("$200 above
            factory invoice) but he laughed me away (without ever telling me how much that would have been). Then I decided
            to compare it to the Geo. The sticker prices of the two cars happened to be almost the same (the Prizm is somewhat
            cheaper but the sunroof and a few extras added more than the Contour's electric mirrors). So I named the same
            figure that the Geo would go for.
        </p>
        <p>
            But first I took care of a little trick that he wanted to play on me: normally, negotiated prices don't include tax, title
            and tags, but sometimes, the dealer also adds "Destination Charges" on top. This can amount to about $500. It's
            purely a trick, since it's already included in the sticker price, so I insisted on dropping it. When he heard
            my figure, he frowned (but didn't laugh!) and said it would be difficult to try and convince the sales manager,
            but that he would try. He was back within a minute. "Congratulations!"
        </p>
        <p>
            So now I had to buy it. OK, the price did sound right, I liked the Contour better than the Prizm, and what the heck -- I
            had to make up my mind one of these days anyway, so why not now. And anyway, I had no choice -- I had promised
            to buy if this price was right.
        </p>
        <p>
            Before I could drive home in my new car, a few formalities had to be fulfilled, and the car had to be cleaned. I was getting
            hungry (it was 4PM and I had sort of skipped lunch, coming to the Auto Park straight from the MVA) but the excitement
            of actually getting the car sort of compensated. My patience was severely tested. I had to wait, sign a thousand
            forms, wait more, sign more forms, listen to a sales talk for optional warranties and anti-rust treatments, wait,
            sign more forms, and finally wait another half hour while the car was being cleaned. The biggest form I had to
            sign was a loan agreement -- in case I wouldn't come up with the cash within ten days, I would have agreed to
            finance the car at some extraordinary rate...
        </p>
        <p>
            So here I am, the proud owner of a brand new 1995 Ford Contour. The color, by the way, is called "champagne" -- it's actually
            a silvery metallic color, with a touch of gold. Ken said this was the color he had wanted for his Contour but
            didn't get, ha ha! In the mean time, I haven't arranged my own insurance yet (I signed a form so it goes on the
            dealer's insurance for loaner cars) and my savings are still underway (I'm praying they arrive in my bank account
            before the 24th of May), but otherwise I'm very happy with my newly acquired piece of freedom. The next thing
            I need now is my own apartment -- time to make a study of the Apartment Shoppers Guide!

        <h2>
            <a name=house>+ House shopping</a>
        </h2>
        <p>
            When I moved in with Roger &amp; Joyce in Silver Spring, I thought it would take me just a few weeks to find my own place.
            What I hadn't counted on were a number of limiting factors, such as: (1) the need to have a car before I could
            go house shopping; (2) I was working long hours (average 9-10 hours in May) and spending an hour and a half or
            two hours per day commuting between Silver Spring and Reston, so at week nights I didn't have any energy left
            to even
            <I>think</I>
            about house shopping (and I often needed the weekends to recover); (3) I had to make my mind up where I wanted to live.
        </p>
        <p>
            Beginning with the latter (deciding where to live), initially I decided I wanted to live in Maryland. Almost all of my friends
            live there and of course they like their state better than "red-neck" Virginia. Also, I dreaded having to go
            through all the hoops again in Virginia to get a new driver's licence, tags for my car, etc. However, it dawned
            upon me that I might not like to commute an hour and a half or more for the rest of the year.
        </p>
        <p>
            It appeared possible to live in Maryland but close to the Virginia border, so I first directed my house hunting to that area
            -- in particular Glen Echo and Bethesda, the suburbs closest to the border. These cummunities are also said to
            have an "artsy" or "liberal" or "left wing" attitude which would suit me just fine. So I looked through the classified
            ads in the Saturday and Sunday morning Washington Post. The category "Unfurnished Apartments for Rent, Maryland"
            seemed to suite me just fine.
        </p>
        <h3>Bethesda or Glen Echo, Maryland...?</h3>
        <p>
            I found lots of ads that mentioned Bethesda as location and didn't explicitly mention "no pets", and started calling the
            listed numbers. Many of the numbers were answered by machines. I left my name and number and why I called, but
            almost nobody returned my call. Fortunately, a few times the phone was picked up by a real person, and after
            verifying that the location was right, and they wouldn't object to a cat, I was allowed to have a look at a few
            places. These were all basement appartments -- given the popularity of the area, that was probably all I could
            hope for within my budget.
        </p>
        <p>
            The first place was rented out by an old couple. This was a basement apartment of a big house, in a nice old part of Glen
            Echo. Unfortunately, that was about the only nice thing you could say about it. The landlady was somewhat retarded
            and confused and paranoid (lots of things I couldn't do), and the apartment was horrible. There were only very
            small windows (OK so it was a basement -- but the house was built on a hill so the entrance was at the garden
            level, yet there was only a tiny window on that side). Adding to the very dark appearence was the prevailing
            color: brown. The ceiling looked like it could fall down any moment. There was no full kitchen -- only a small
            sink and a microwave and a "bar style" counter. There were a washer/dryer to be shared with the landlord's family,
            who preferred to do their laundry on Saturday mornings -- my preferred day to sleep in. On top of all that, there
            was a very noisy heater and air conditioner in one corner, serving the whole house. I thanked the couple for
            showing me around, even took their application form, and left.
        </p>
        <p>
            The next place I looked at was ten thousand times better. Also a basement apartment, it was brand new, with a fully equipped
            kitchen (OK so there wasn't a lot of space besides sink, stove and fridge), no shared appliances, and a friendly
            yuppie couple as landlords (she as American as they come, he from Algeria and talking with a thick French accent,
            both very nice and eager to rent so they could pay the mortgage). The only big problem was that the house was
            on a busy main road. While the front yard was big enough that the cars and buses didn't appear to drive through
            the bedroom (thanks to double paned windows), it would be impossible to let Tom outside -- I'd fear for his life
            every minute. Sure, he's not blind or deaf and rather intelligent for a cat, but evolutionally he's just not
            equipped to cope with things coming at him at a speed of 40 miles per hour. And after the time he'd spent at
            Roger &amp; Joyce's place, where he could freely walk in and out and play in the woods, I'd hate to lock him
            inside for the rest of the year.
        </p>
        <p>
            I found location number three through a real estate agent who'd left a business card on the bulletin board of the Glen Echo
            CO-OP (an environmentally correct health food store). He found an address in his database and made an appointment
            for me to come and see it Monday evening after work. Good, I though, then I can test how long the commute will
            be! By the time I found the place I had decided that I wouldn't take it -- it took me 40 minutes. This was probably
            a bad day for traffic and I wasted a little time finding it, but this was clearly not a significant improvement
            over living in Silver Spring! So when the door was answered by a young couple who had just moved in a week ago
            (must've been a mistake in the realtor's database that it was still listed as "available") I wasn't at all disappointed
            -- even though this would have been an ideal place for me &amp; Tom to live.
        </p>
        <p>
            Right there and then, I decided that I would start looking in Virginia instead. The next day I called Ken Buchanan, a Virginia
            realtor who had been recommended to my by a number of people at CNRI. I had talked to Ken before, but since he
            only works in Virginia I had initially decided not to pursue it any further. Now I was ready for him, and he
            was ready for me.
        </p>
        <h3>Vienna, Virginia...?</h3>
        <p>
            But first, I looked at the Virginia section of the classified ads, and had a look at two of them. One was a nice and tidy
            small townhouse in Vienna, maybe 20 minutes from Reston, in a quiet neighborhood, surrounded by trees. (A townhouse
            is a single-family home in a row of similar homes -- what the Dutch call "rijtjeshuis". Townhouses are looked
            down upon somewhat because they defeat the American Dream principle of a free-standing home for everyone. I could've
            looked for apartments but most of those are in highrises which don't tickle my fancy very much.) The owner had
            lived there before and she told me she liked the neighborhood so much that they'd bought a new home less than
            mile away. The only drawback for me was that it appeared to be a a little far away -- the road from Reston to
            Vienna is narrow and busy, and there are some nasty stoplights in Vienna. Also I wasn't ready to say "yes" right
            there and then yet to the first place that I actually liked.
        </p>
        <p>
            Another place I visited in Vienna was a three bedroom basement apartment. It had doors opening to a lawn and the rooms on
            that side were bright enough, but in general it made a fairly dark impression. Another thing about it that I
            didn't like about it was the building style: a row of four-storey concrete blocks, separated by lawns and trees.
            Sure, in the seventies it must have looked very modern and bright, and I've seen much worse in poor neighborhoods,
            but it just didn't feel right.
        </p>
        <h3>Reston, Virginia...?</h3>
        <p>
            By this time, Ken Buchanan had a whole collection of townhouses lined up for me. He gave me a list of ten different townhouses
            for rent in Reston. He'd checked all of them for availability and acceptability of pets. (These realtor's computer
            print-outs are amazing. Unfortunately it took me a long time before I understand enough of their abbrev's --
            "OWC PET" means "Owner Will Consider Pet", a very important for me!)
        </p>
        <p>
            I took a couple of hours off one afternoon and had a look (on my own) from the outside at every single townhouse on Ken's
            list. There sure is a lot of variation in townhouses! Some were HUGE, others not so. Some were built of concrete
            in the seventies and showing serious signs of decay. Some seemed to be located in lousy areas -- bored highschool
            kids hanging around in the parking lots, lots of trash, tiny gardens. Others seemed to be built in totally sterile
            locations, everything neat and tidy, "Neighborhood Watch" signs at every corner. Some were just right except
            that they were very close to a busy road.
        </p>
        <p>
            There was one that looked just right for me and Tom. Tucked away at the end of a small neighborhood, with woods and (according
            to my map) a little stream behind it, and the sun shining upon it at just the right angle, it simply invited
            me to come and live there. Better still, it was about five minutes (by car) away from CNRI, mostly on quiet streets.
        </p>
        <p>
            So I called Ken Buchanan, and the next day we went there and visited the inside. It was less tidy than what I'd hoped for.
            The current tenant hadn't really taken good care of it, the kitchen was filthy, and there were two smelly ferrets
            in cages in the basement. (Why anybody would want a ferret as a pet is beyond me, but they are very popular here!)
            Yet, if the landlord would clean up (that's usually part of the contract anyway) the current tenant's mess was
            none of my business, and otherwise the place looked fine -- no holes in the walls, as Ken expressed it, and the
            airconditioning appeared to work fine (a definite requirement in this part of the country). So together with
            Ken I filled out a three-page application form and a standardized five-page rental agreement form, both in quadruplicate,
            gave Ken a check for $20 for processing of the application, and said my prayers.
        </p>
        <p>
            The next day, Friday, about 20 mintes to 6, as I was about to finish up and go to the premiere of Batman Forever with Ken,
            Barary &amp; Jane, I got a call from Ken. In our hurry to get the forms filled out we had overlooked a few details.
            I had to initial each page of each form (I'd only signed the last page of each) and the check I had written was
            in the wrong name (it should be the landlord's realtor). I hurried over to Ken's office to correct the mistakes
            and, due to exceptionally light traffic, made it to the movie in time.
        </p>
        <p>
            By Monday, Ken hadn't heard from the landlord's realtor yet. That evening he finally heard from them, but it was not all
            good news: I had to fill out a different application form, which cost $15 more, and moreover, because of the
            unlikelihood of getting my credit checked in the usual way, they wanted someone from CNRI to co-sign the lease.
            This was quite unusual, and I quickly found out that CNRI would have nothing of it. After all, this makes the
            co-signer responsible for any debts if I were to disappear. Instead, we planned a scheme whereby my credit cards
            would serve as a reference for my good credit. But the next morning, after I'd filled out the new form and written
            a new check, Ken looked in his computer again, and found out that the place was now rented to someone else. Nasty.
            Of course you can't prove anything, but it sure sounded like they had just given me three impossible things to
            do to buy some time...
        </p>
        <h3>Reston, Virginia...!</h3>
        <p>
            But Ken didn't despair. Within twenty minutes he faxed me a new list of ten places to look at. Some I had already seen and
            rejected in my first round, but there were a few new ones and one for which I couldn't remember why I didn't
            like it so just to be sure I had another look at it. This one and another one in the same neighborhood actually
            looked quite alright from the outside, so that same evening Ken and I had a look at both inside.
        </p>
        <p>
            It was easily decided which one we would try first. There was one that was available immediately, immaculately clean. It
            had an interesting, unusual wedge-shaped floor plan, with one large room on each of three floors. The other was
            more traditional, with no basement and three small bedrooms upstairs, and the current tenants, who had lots of
            junk and (yes!) a ferret for a pet, were in the middle of moving out (not that we met them -- it was obvious
            from the piles of stuff on the floor and the disconnected washer in the middle of one room).
        </p>
        <p>
            We managed to recycle most of the rental application and lease forms that I had already filled out, so we had to fill out
            only a new front page of each (listing the correct address and so forth). I'd run out of checks (luckily I'd
            gotten them all back unused), so I gave Ken $30 in cash for the application fee. This was very unusual, he said,
            and indeed, we later found out that the office processing the application had faxed copies of the bills to the
            owner, who had a good laugh out of it but not the warm fuzzy feeling he would've gotten from a faxed copy of
            a check written in his name. Oh well...
        </p>
        <p>
            A day later Ken called me again. This time we were lucky! My lacking credit record did not put off this owner or his realtor,
            and they definitely went for my offer (Ken's idea) to start renting the last week of June instead of per July
            1st -- this yielded an extra week's rent.
        </p>
        <p>
            So on Saturday morning, 11 AM, Ken &amp; I showed up at my new address, and met the landlord (an airline pilot) and his agent.
            We filled in a few blanks in the lease form and initialed them, I handed over two banker's checks (one for the
            rent, one as a deposit) that my bank had printed for me earlier at a $20 fee (cash would have been easier but
            by now I had grasped that no-one in this country likes cash any more...).
        </p>
        <p>
            There were some minor formalities, and we found an unpleasant surprise in the basement level room: someone had (very recently,
            since Ken &amp; I had looked at the place two days before) tried to break in. They hadn't succeeded, but they
            had broken the flyscreen and one pane of glass in the double-paned door. Luckily, the landlord took full responsibility
            and called the police and promised to have it fixed. His insurance would probably pay for it anyway.
        </p>
        <p>
            Much though I'd wanted to, I couldn't move in the same day: I had three more social engagements that more than filled my
            day. First there was a special Contact Improv class that would last most of the afternoon; next, Joyce's sister
            Lynn gave a dinner party; and finally, I wanted to see Barry's new band play at a club in downtown Bethesda later
            that night (the band wasn't new, but Barry is their new base player).
        </p>
        <p>
            But Sunday, nothing was going to stop my. I packed a small part of my stuff in two suitcases and drove over. On the way,
            I bought some essentials that I thought I couldn't live without, like a vacuum cleaner, a telephone and a bunch
            of towels (remember, I came into this country carrying two suitcases full of clothes and CDs and not much else;
            since then I've bought a computer and some books and more CDs, but hardly anything else).
        </p>
        <p>
            Once I'd delivered this to my new address, there was more shopping to do: cat food and cat litter, bowls and a litter box,
            and all those things everyone has in the kitchen like spunges, a trash can, dish cloths, hand soap, plastic containers,
            etc. Luckily, this is a one-stop shopping country, and I could find all of this at K-mart. I could've picked
            up the cat things there too, but as a matter of principle I bought that at the local pet store -- unfortunately
            it looked like it was about to go out of business, if not by lack of clientele or through K-mart's competition,
            then probably because the owner, a friendly and helpful woman in her late 40s, couldn't count or calculate my
            change correctly if her life depended on it...
        </p>
        <p>
            Next stop, Mattress Discounters. The salesman, the type full of old jokes, let me try a numer of different mattress styles,
            and sold me the most expensive Queen Size mattress in the store, at a discount price because it was the week
            of the fourth of July sale. I let him do it because I didn't want to waste time shopping around, and what good
            is a home without a bed? Unfortunately, he couldn't deliver it until Thursday.
        </p>
        <p>
            By now, I had really set my mind on moving in today, so (once back in Silver Spring to pick up Tom and the few remaining
            bits of my stuff) I called Ken for help. He promised to lend me an old futon of his (this is a sort of flat mattress
            made of cotton, very popular with new age people). It turned out that, with Tom on the front seat, my computer
            in boxes on the rear seats and some other bulky stuff (like my CD collection, two months of accumulated paperwork,
            and the only piece of furniture I had bought so far -- a standing 300 Watt halogen lamp of which there are at
            least five in every home, since Home Depot sells them under $17 a piece) in the trunk, the only place where the
            futon would fit was on top of the computer, blocking my rear view mirror completely. Oh well, for once I would
            have drive only 55 miles per hour in the rightmost lane on the Beltway, rather than passing everyone at 70 in
            the leftmost lane. It was worth it!
        </p>
        <p>
            Tom, by the way, did not like the trip. He was in alarm mode the entire time, which means that he emits one extremely loud
            and frightful miaow about every three seconds. I let him out of his box, and he explored the car (minus the driver's
            seat, fortunately) but this didn't stop him from complaining. Neither did friendly words, caresses, or anything
            else I could think of, even tuning the radio to a classical station.
        </p>
        <p>
            Upon arrival he quieted down almost immediately. However, he hasn't yet taken a liking of his new surroundings. I think it
            is the lack of furtinure that's putting him off -- there are no couches to hide on, chairs to sit on, or dressers
            to hide behind. He has inspected all walk-in closets and decided that the best place for him to hide is in the
            closet where I keep my clothes (perhaps this gives hime the most "inhabited" feel), underneath the shoe-rack.
            This probably really is the best hiding spot in the house -- the amazing thing is that he found it within ten
            minutes.
        </p>
        <p>
            This is about the state of things at the moment. I've convinced the water and electricity companies to keep me connected
            and send me the bills, and Bell Atlantic is willing to connect me to their phone system on Thursday if I go and
            pay a $40 deposit at a bank now. So I'd better take a break and do it! The next big shopping spree will probably
            be to IKEA, the Swedish furniture giant, whose slogan is "It's a big country -- somebody's got to furnish it",
            below a statue of Lincoln painted in bright primary colors. We'll see...
