                map showing the house</a>. I'll try to put up a picture here as soon as I have one. In the mean time, here's
            a
            <a href="http://tours.bamboo.com/usa/va/FX3030868.htm" target="_blank">virtual tour</a>
            of the house and the view from the dock, prepared by the real estate company.
        </p>
        <p>We're really excited about the house. For me, this is the first house I've ever bought. Kim owns her home in Baltimore,
            which she'll keep for a few years while she still works there. But the decision to buy this house was made together,
            and she's doing everything she can to find work in Reston so she can spend more time here. The house is exactly
            one mile from my office, so I can leave the car at home!
        </p>
        <p>The house was built in 1977, in a contemporary style - it's a townhouse with brick and wood walls. It's in excellent
            condition, although the kitchen needs modernization (it still has the original cooking range and brown formica
            cabinets!). There are four levels: a finished basement large enough for Kim to teach aikido, a roomy main level
            with kitchen, dining and living room (with hardwood floors, a deck, and a fireplace!), and two upper levels:
            on the first level are three bedrooms and two bathrooms, the second level has a "party room" with a deck. From
            there you can see lake Thoreau - at least in the fall and winter seasons, when the trees don't block the view.
            There are plenty of trees in the neighborhood, and even if you can't see the lake, it's only a minute out the
            back door to get to the docks. I believe you can even swim there!
        </p>
        <p>
            Of course, we're even more excited about our wedding, but that's still more than six months away!
