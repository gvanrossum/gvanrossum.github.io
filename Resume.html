Guido van Rossum - Resume</H1>

(See also my <A HREF="Publications.html">publications list</A> and my
<A HREF="./index.html">personal home page</A>.)

<H3>Current</H3>

<p>Distinguished Engineer in the Developer Division at
    <a href="https://microsoft.com">Microsoft</a>, since November 2020.</p>

<p>From October 2019 till October 2020 I was retired.</p>

<H3>Previous Work in the US</H3>

<p>From January 2013 through October 2019, I worked for <a
href="http://www.dropbox.com">Dropbox</a>, where most recently I worked on
<a href="https://blogs.dropbox.com/tech/2019/09/our-journey-to-type-checking-4-million-lines-of-python/">mypy</a>
and on migrating over 5 million lines of server-side code from Python 2 to Python 3.

<p>From December 2005 till December 2012, I worked
for <a href="http://www.google.com">Google</a>.  My first project was
an internal code review tool,
<a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CKjRt48rZGk">Mondrian</a>.
After that I worked on the
<a href="https://cloud.google.com/appengine/">App Engine</a>
project, where I worked on the
<a href="https://appengine.google.com/">Admin Console</a>, the
<a href=https://cloud.google.com/appengine/docs/standard/python/tools/appstats">Appstats</a>
library, the
<a href="https://cloud.google.com/appengine/docs/standard/python/ndb/">NDB</a>
library, and created an open-source code review tool,
<a href="https://github.com/rietveld-codereview/rietveld">Rietveld</a>.

<p>From July 2003 till December 2005, I worked for <a
href="http://www.elementalsecurity.com">Elemental Security</a>,
founded by Dan Farmer, as Senior Language Architect.
The one thing I built here that had a lasting effect was
a Python version of pgen, Python's parser generator, now
immortalized in the Python standard library is lib2to3/pgen2/.

<P>From October 2000 till July 2003, I worked for <A
HREF="http://www.zope.com"
>Zope Corporation</a> as Director of PythonLabs.

<P>From May through October 2000, I worked for BeOpen.com as Director
of PythonLabs.

<P>From April 1995 to February 1998, I was a guest researcher for the
U.S. National Institute of Standards and Technology (<A
HREF="http://www.nist.gov">NIST</A>) in Gaithersburg, Maryland,
working at the Corporation for National Research Initiatives (<A
HREF="http://www.cnri.reston.va.us">CNRI</A>) in Reston, Virginia.
From March 1998 to May 2000 I was an employee of CNRI doing
essentially the same work.  The research was on mobile agents in
distributed systems using interpreted languages.  Most of the work
involved <A HREF="http://www.python.org" >Python</A>, an interpreted,
object-oriented programming language of my own invention.  As an
elaborate example, I wrote <a href="http://grail.sf.net">Grail</a>,
the first web browser written in Python.  During this time I also
wrote a funding proposal, <a
href="https://www.python.org/doc/essays/cp4e/">Computer Programming for
Everybody</a>, that was funded by DARPA.

<P>From mid October till mid December 1994 I was a guest researcher at
<A HREF="http://www.nist.gov">NIST</A>, working on <A
HREF="http://www.python.org">Python</A>.  NIST sponsored my visit to
the Usenix Symposium on Very High Level Languages in Santa Fe and
organized the <A HREF="http://legacy.python.org/workshops/">First Python
Workshop</A>.

<H3>Previous Work outside the US</H3>

<P>From 1991 till 1995 I worked in the multimedia group at <A
HREF="http://www.cwi.nl/">CWI</A>, headed by <A
HREF="http://homepages.cwi.nl/~dcab/">Dick
Bulterman</A>.  The group was working on authoring software for
hypermedia presentations (both implementations and theoretical models)
and on operating system and network support for multimedia and
hypermedia, in particular synchronization of independent streams.
They maintained a <A
HREF="https://web.archive.org/web/19990225081903/http://www.cwi.nl:80/ftp/mmpapers/">directory</A> containing
compressed Postscript of publications by the group.  Most of the
group's implementation work (even after my departure) was done in <A
HREF="http://www.python.org">Python</A>.
