        <h3>Current Employment</h3>
        <p>
            As of January 2013, I work for
            <a href="http://www.dropbox.com" target="_blank">Dropbox</a>. (As previously at Google, I have a deal where I can spend up to 50% of my time on Python.)
        </p>
        <h3>Previous Work in the US</h3>
        <p>
            From December 2005 till December 2012, I worked for
            <a href="http://www.google.com" target="_blank">Google</a>. My first project was an internal code review tool,
            <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CKjRt48rZGk" target="_blank">Mondrian</a>. After that I worked on the
            <a href="https://developers.google.com/appengine/" target="_blank">App Engine</a>
            project, where I worked on the
            <a href="https://appengine.google.com/" target="_blank">Admin Console</a>, the
            <a href="https://developers.google.com/appengine/docs/python/tools/appstats" target="_blank">Appstats</a>
            library, the
            <a href="https://developers.google.com/appengine/docs/python/ndb/" target="_blank">NDB</a>
            library, and created an open-source code review tool,
            <a href="http://code.google.com/p/rietveld/" target="_blank">Rietveld</a>.
        </p>
        <p>
            From July 2003 till December 2005, I worked for
            <a href="http://www.elementalsecurity.com" target="_blank">Elemental Security</a>, founded by Dan Farmer, as Senior Language Architect. The one thing I built here that
            had a lasting effect was a Python version of pgen, Python's parser generator, now immortalized in the Python
            standard library is lib2to3/pgen2/.
        </p>
        <p>
            From October 2000 till July 2003, I worked for
            <a href="http://www.zope.com" target="_blank">Zope Corporation</a> as Director of PythonLabs.
        </p>
        <p>
            From May through October 2000, I worked for BeOpen.com as Director of PythonLabs.
        </p>
        <p>
            From April 1995 to February 1998, I was a guest researcher for the U.S. National Institute of Standards and Technology (
            <a href="http://www.nist.gov" target="_blank">NIST</a>) in Gaithersburg, Maryland, working at the Corporation for National Research Initiatives (
            <a href="http://www.cnri.reston.va.us" target="_blank">CNRI</a>) in Reston, Virginia. From March 1998 to May 2000 I was an employee of CNRI doing essentially the same
            work. The research was on mobile agents in distributed systems using interpreted languages. Most of the work
            involved
            <a href="http://www.python.org" target="_blank">Python</a>, an interpreted, object-oriented programming language of my own invention. As an elaborate example,
            I wrote
            <a href="http://grail.sf.net" target="_blank">Grail</a>, the first web browser written in Python. During this time I also wrote a funding proposal,
            <a href="https://www.python.org/doc/essays/cp4e/" target="_blank">Computer Programming for Everybody
            </a>, that was funded by DARPA.
        </p>
        <p>
            From mid October till mid December 1994 I was a guest researcher at
            <a href="http://www.nist.gov" target="_blank">NIST</a>, working on
            <a href="http://www.python.org" target="_blank">Python</a>. NIST sponsored my visit to the Usenix Symposium on Very High Level Languages in Santa Fe and organized
            the
            <a href="http://legacy.python.org/workshops/" target="_blank">First Python Workshop</a>.
        </p>
        <h3>Previous Work outside the US</h3>
        <p>
            From 1991 till 1995 I worked in the multimedia group at
            <a href="http://www.cwi.nl/" target="_blank">CWI</a>, headed by
            <a href="http://homepages.cwi.nl/~dcab/" target="_blank">Dick Bulterman
            </a>. The group was working on authoring software for hypermedia presentations (both implementations and theoretical
            models) and on operating system and network support for multimedia and hypermedia, in particular synchronization
            of independent streams. They maintained a
            <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/19990225081903/http://www.cwi.nl:80/ftp/mmpapers/" target="_blank">directory</a> containing compressed Postscript of publications by the group. Most of the group's implementation
            work (even after my departure) was done in
            <a href="http://www.python.org" target="_blank">Python</a>.
        </p>
        <h3>Older Projects</h3>
        <p>
            I was involved in several other projects at
            <a href="http://www.cwi.nl/" target="_blank">CWI</a>:
            <ul>
                <li>From 1986 till 1991 I was with the Amoeba project, headed by

                    <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20050730074915/http://www.cs.vu.nl/vakgroepen/cs/amoeba_papers.html" target="_blank">Amoeba</a> is a distributed operating system developed jointly with the
                    <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20061006040156/http://www.cs.vu.nl:80/vakgroepen/cs/top.html" target="_blank">Computer Systems Group

                    <a href="http://www.cwi.nl/~steven/abc.html" target="_blank">ABC</a>, a programming language and environment for programming by non-expert users.
