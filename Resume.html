Guido van Rossum - Resume</H1>

(See also my <A HREF="Publications.html">publications list</A> and my
<A HREF="./">personal home page</A>.)

<H3>Current Employment</H3>

<p>As of January 2013, I work for <a
href="http://www.dropbox.com">Dropbox</a>.
(As previously at Google, I have a deal where I can spend up to 50% of
my time on Python.)

<H3>Previous Work in the US</H3>

<p>From December 2005 till December 2012, I worked
for <a href="http://www.google.com">Google</a>.  My first project was
an internal code review tool,
<a href=http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CKjRt48rZGk>Mondrian</a>.
After that I worked on the
<a href=https://developers.google.com/appengine/>App Engine</a>
project, where I worked on the
<a href=https://appengine.google.com/>Admin Console</a>, the
<a href=https://developers.google.com/appengine/docs/python/tools/appstats>Appstats</a>
library, the
<a href=https://developers.google.com/appengine/docs/python/ndb/>NDB</a>
library, and created an open-source code review tool,
<a href=http://code.google.com/p/rietveld/>Rietveld</a>.

<p>From July 2003 till December 2005, I worked for <a
href="http://www.elementalsecurity.com">Elemental Security</a>,
founded by Dan Farmer, as Senior Language Architect.
The one thing I built here that had a lasting effect was
a Python version of pgen, Python's parser generator, now
immortalized in the Python standard library is lib2to3/pgen2/.

<P>From October 2000 till July 2003, I worked for <A
HREF="http://www.zope.com"
>Zope Corporation</a> as Director of PythonLabs.

<P>From May through October 2000, I worked for BeOpen.com as Director
of PythonLabs.

<P>From April 1995 to February 1998, I was a guest researcher for the
U.S. National Institute of Standards and Technology (<A
HREF="http://www.nist.gov">NIST</A>) in Gaithersburg, Maryland,
working at the Corporation for National Research Initiatives (<A
HREF="http://www.cnri.reston.va.us">CNRI</A>) in Reston, Virginia.
From March 1998 to May 2000 I was an employee of CNRI doing
essentially the same work.  The research was on mobile agents in
distributed systems using interpreted languages.  Most of the work
involved <A HREF="http://www.python.org" >Python</A>, an interpreted,
object-oriented programming language of my own invention.  As an
elaborate example, I wrote <a href="http://grail.sf.net">Grail</a>,
the first web browser written in Python.  During this time I also
wrote a funding proposal, <a
href="https://www.python.org/doc/essays/cp4e/">Computer Programming for
Everybody</a>, that was funded by DARPA.

<P>From mid October till mid December 1994 I was a guest researcher at
<A HREF="http://www.nist.gov">NIST</A>, working on <A
HREF="http://www.python.org">Python</A>.  NIST sponsored my visit to
the Usenix Symposium on Very High Level Languages in Santa Fe and
organized the <A HREF="http://legacy.python.org/workshops/">First Python
Workshop</A>.

<H3>Previous Work outside the US</H3>

<P>From 1991 till 1995 I worked in the multimedia group at <A
HREF="http://www.cwi.nl/">CWI</A>, headed by <A
HREF="http://homepages.cwi.nl/~dcab/">Dick
Bulterman</A>.  The group was working on authoring software for
hypermedia presentations (both implementations and theoretical models)
and on operating system and network support for multimedia and
hypermedia, in particular synchronization of independent streams.
They maintained a <A
HREF="https://web.archive.org/web/19990225081903/http://www.cwi.nl:80/ftp/mmpapers/">directory</A> containing
compressed Postscript of publications by the group.  Most of the
group's implementation work (even after my departure) was done in <A
HREF="http://www.python.org">Python</A>.

<H3>Older Projects</H3>

<P>I was involved in several other projects at <A

<LI>From 1982 till 1986 I was a member of the ABC group, headed by <A
HREF="http://www.cs.uu.nl/staff/lambert.html">Lambert
Meertens</A> and <A
HREF="http://homepages.cwi.nl/~steven/">Steven
Pemberton</A>, where my task was the design and implementation of <A

language and environment for programming by non-expert users.<P>

</UL>

<P>From 1977 till 1982 I worked part-time for

<H3>Education</H3>

<P>I received a Master's degree in Mathematics and Computer Science
from the <A HREF="http://www.uva.nl/">University of Amsterdam</A> in
1982, and joined CWI as a researcher in the same year.  While
studying, I worked for 5 years as a systems programmer at Amsterdam's
academic computer center, <A HREF="http://www.sara.nl/">SARA</A>.
