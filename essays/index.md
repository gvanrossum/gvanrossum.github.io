# GvR Essays

Most of my old essays (most pre-2000) are collected on the
[legacy python.org site](https://legacy.python.org/doc/essays/).

For some reason only one of those is duplicated here:
[Implementing Graphs](graphs.html).

A new essay I have started in 2022 is
[Towards Formal Semantics For PythonÌ£](formal.md).
