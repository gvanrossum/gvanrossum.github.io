<H1>Python Presentations</H1>

<P>In this directory I place slides of presentations I have given.
Most presentations are available in HTML and PowerPoint (view the HTML
index page and the follow the link labeled "Download presentation
source").  [For the newer presentations I've given up making HTML.
The HTML that PowerPoint generates gets worse with each
version it seems.  Thanks to Steve Holden for providing PDF.]

<DT><A HREF="sd99east/index.htm">Using Python for CGI Programming</A>
- 12 November 1999.

<DD>A brief generic Python tutorial followed by a tutorial on CGI
programming using Python and a case study.  These are the slides that
I used at <A HREF="http://www.sdexpo.com/">Software Development '99
East</A> in Washington, DC.  I never got to present the case study
part, and the tail of both prior tutorials had to be cut off due to
time constraints (ain't I bad :-).  So here is all the material I had
presented.  Note that these are <b>entirely different</b> slides than
the ones on the SD'99 website -- that was a longer tutorial plus some
advanced Python material without any of the CGI material.
