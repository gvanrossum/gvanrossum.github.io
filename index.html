<p>Read
my <a href="http://neopythonic.blogspot.com/2016/04/kings-day-speech.html">"King's
Day Speech"</a> for some inspiration.

<P>I am the author of the <A HREF="http://www.python.org" >Python</A>
programming language.  See also my <A HREF="Resume.html">resume</A>
and my <A HREF="Publications.html">publications list</A>, a <A
HREF="bio.html" >brief bio</A>, assorted <a
href="http://legacy.python.org/doc/essays/">writings</a>, <a
href="http://legacy.python.org/doc/essays/ppt/">presentations</a> and <a
href="interviews.html">interviews</a> (all about Python), some
<a href="pics.html">pictures of me</a>,
<a href="http://neopythonic.blogspot.com">my new blog</a>, and
my <a href="http://www.artima.com/weblogs/index.jsp?blogger=12088">old
blog</a> on Artima.com.  I am
<a href=https://twitter.com/gvanrossum>@gvanrossum</a> on Twitter.

<p>I am retired, working on personal projects (and maybe a book).
I have worked for Dropbox, Google, Elemental Security, Zope
Corporation, BeOpen.com, CNRI, CWI, and SARA.  (See
my <a href=Resume.html>resume</a>.)  I created Python while at CWI.

<H3>How to Reach Me</H3>

<P>You can send email for me to guido (at) python.org.
I read everything sent there, but I receive too much email to respond
to everything.

<H3>My Name</H3>

<P>My name often poses difficulties for Americans.

<P><b>Pronunciation:</b> in Dutch, the "G" in Guido is a hard G,
pronounced roughly like the "ch" in Scottish "loch".  (Listen to the
<A HREF="guido.au">sound clip</A>.)  However, if you're
American, you may also pronounce it as the Italian "Guido".  I'm not
too worried about the associations with mob assassins that some people
have. :-)

<P><b>Spelling:</b> my last name is two words, and I'd like to keep it
that way, the spelling on some of my credit cards notwithstanding.
Dutch spelling rules dictate that when used in combination with my
first name, "van" is not capitalized: "Guido van Rossum".  But when my
last name is used alone to refer to me, it is capitalized, for
example: "As usual, Van Rossum was right."

<P><b>Alphabetization:</b> in America, I show up in the alphabet under
"V".  But in Europe, I show up under "R".  And some of my friends put
me under "G" in their address book...
