<H3><a href="images/df20000406.jpg" >Who I Am</a></H3>

<p>Read
my <a href="http://neopythonic.blogspot.com/2016/04/kings-day-speech.html">"King's
Day Speech"</a> for some inspiration.

<P>I am the author of the <A HREF="http://www.python.org" >Python</A>
programming language.  See also my <A HREF="Resume.html">resume</A>
and my <A HREF="Publications.html">publications list</A>, a <A
HREF="bio.html" >brief bio</A>, assorted <a
href="http://legacy.python.org/doc/essays/">writings</a>, <a
href="http://legacy.python.org/doc/essays/ppt/">presentations</a> and <a
href="interviews.html">interviews</a> (all about Python), some
<a href="pics.html">pictures of me</a>,
<a href="http://neopythonic.blogspot.com">my new blog</a>, and
my <a href="http://www.artima.com/weblogs/index.jsp?blogger=12088">old
blog</a> on Artima.com.  I am
<a href=https://twitter.com/gvanrossum>@gvanrossum</a> on Twitter.

<p>I am currently a Distinguished Engineer at Microsoft.
I have worked for Dropbox, Google, Elemental Security, Zope
Corporation, BeOpen.com, CNRI, CWI, and SARA.  (See
my <a href=Resume.html>resume</a>.)  I created Python while at CWI.

<H3>How to Reach Me</H3>

<P>You can send email for me to guido (at) python.org.
I read everything sent there, but I receive too much email to respond
to everything.

<P>Please understand that I do not give talks or keynotes any more,
nor do I participate in podcasts or give interviews, etc.
I am sorry, but I just receive too many such requests to decline
them individually.
Offering payment or trips to exotic locales just makes things worse, sorry.

<P>I also prefer not to receive questions about how to use Python
(please read the <a href="https://docs.python.org">documentation</a> or search the internet for Python answers forums),
bug reports (use the <a href="https://github.com/python/cpython/issues">GitHub issue tracker</a>),
proposals for changes to the language (use <a href="https://discuss.python.org">Discourse</a>),
job offers (I'm happy where I am),
or requests to join you in some far-fetched scheme to save humanity (though sometimes I like me a good rant :-).

<H3>My Name</H3>

<P>My name often poses difficulties for Americans.

<P><b>Pronunciation:</b> in Dutch, the "G" in Guido is a hard G,
pronounced roughly like the "ch" in Scottish "loch".  (Listen to the
<A HREF="guido.au">sound clip</A>.)  However, if you're
American, you may also pronounce it as the Italian "Guido".  I'm not
too worried about the associations with mob assassins that some people
have. :-)

<P><b>Spelling:</b> my last name is two words, and I'd like to keep it
that way, the spelling on some of my credit cards notwithstanding.
Dutch spelling rules dictate that when used in combination with my
first name, "van" is not capitalized: "Guido van Rossum".  But when my
last name is used alone to refer to me, it is capitalized, for
example: "As usual, Van Rossum was right."

<P><b>Alphabetization:</b> in America, I show up in the alphabet under
"V".  But in Europe, I show up under "R".  And some of my friends put
me under "G" in their address book...
