<p>Read
my <a href="http://neopythonic.blogspot.com/2016/04/kings-day-speech.html">"King's
Day Speech"</a> for some inspiration.

<P>I am the author of the <A HREF="http://www.python.org" >Python</A>
programming language.  See also my <A HREF="Resume.html">resume</A>
and my <A HREF="Publications.html">publications list</A>, a <A
HREF="bio.html" >brief bio</A>, assorted <a
href="http://legacy.python.org/doc/essays/">writings</a>, <a

href="interviews.html">interviews</a> (all about Python), some
<a href="pics.html">pictures of me</a>,
<a href="http://neopythonic.blogspot.com">my new blog</a>, and
my <a href="http://www.artima.com/weblogs/index.jsp?blogger=12088">old
blog</a> on Artima.com.  I am
<a href=https://twitter.com/gvanrossum>@gvanrossum</a> on Twitter.

<p>In January 2013 I joined
<a href=http://www.dropbox.com>Dropbox</a>.  I work on various Dropbox
products and have 50% for my Python work, no strings attached.
Previously, I have worked for Google, Elemental Security, Zope
Corporation, BeOpen.com, CNRI, CWI, and SARA.  (See
my <a href=Resume.html>resume</a>.)  I created Python while at CWI.

<H3>How to Reach Me</H3>

<P>You can send email for me to guido (at) python.org.
I read everything sent there, but if you ask
me a question about using Python, it's likely that I won't have time
to answer it, and will instead refer you to
help (at) python.org,
<a href="http://groups.google.com/groups?q=comp.lang.python"
>comp.lang.python</a> or
<a href=http://stackoverflow.com>StackOverflow</a>.  If you need to
talk to me on the phone or send me something by snail mail, send me an
email and I'll gladly email you instructions on how to reach me.

<H3>My Name</H3>

<P>My name often poses difficulties for Americans.

<P><b>Pronunciation:</b> in Dutch, the "G" in Guido is a hard G,
pronounced roughly like the "ch" in Scottish "loch".  (Listen to the
<A HREF="guido.au">sound clip</A>.)  However, if you're
American, you may also pronounce it as the Italian "Guido".  I'm not
too worried about the associations with mob assassins that some people
have. :-)

<P><b>Spelling:</b> my last name is two words, and I'd like to keep it
that way, the spelling on some of my credit cards notwithstanding.
Dutch spelling rules dictate that when used in combination with my
first name, "van" is not capitalized: "Guido van Rossum".  But when my
last name is used alone to refer to me, it is capitalized, for
example: "As usual, Van Rossum was right."

<P><b>Alphabetization:</b> in America, I show up in the alphabet under
"V".  But in Europe, I show up under "R".  And some of my friends put
me under "G" in their address book...
