Guido van Rossum is the creator of the Python programming language. He
grew up in the Netherlands and studied at the University of Amsterdam,
where he graduated with a Master's Degree in Mathematics and Computer
Science. His first job after college was as a programmer at CWI, where
he worked on the ABC language, the Amoeba distributed operating
system, and a variety of multimedia projects. During this time he
created Python as side project. He then moved to the United States to
take a job at a non-profit research lab in Virginia, married a Texan,
worked for several other startups, and moved to California. In
2005 he joined Google, where he obtained the rank of Senior Staff
Engineer, and in 2013 he started working for Dropbox as a Principal
Engineer. In October 2019 he retired. After a short retirement he joined
Microsoft as Distinguished Engineer in 2020. Until 2018 he was Python's
BDFL (Benevolent Dictator For Life), and he is still deeply involved
in the Python community. Guido, his wife and their teenager live in
Silicon Valley, where they love hiking, biking and birding.
