Guido van Rossum - Brief Bio</H1>

<BLOCKQUOTE><i>Here's a brief bio that I send to people who ask me for
one.  You can also use the photo above (taken in 2002; it links to
the original at 1600x1200).</i></BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>Guido van Rossum is the creator of Python, one of the major
programming languages on and off the web.  In 2018 Guido retired
as Benevolent Dictator For Life ("BDFL"), a title seemingly
from a Monty Python skit.  He is now Emeritus BDFL and happily sits on
the Python Steering Council, a five-person group that will give
guidance to the future roadmap of the Python programming language.

<P>He moved from the Netherlands to the USA in 1995, where he met his
wife.  Until July 2003 they lived in the northern Virginia suburbs of
Washington, DC with their son Orlijn, who was born in 2001.  They then
moved to Silicon Valley where Guido worked for a variety of
companies including Google and Dropbox (spending 50%
of his time on Python!).

<p>Guido's home on the web is <A HREF="http://www.python.org/~guido/"
